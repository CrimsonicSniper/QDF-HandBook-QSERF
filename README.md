# **The QDF Handbook**

_All in-service, enlisted QDF operatives are granted authorization to view this document and its contents._

_Failure to comply with Rule 1 (no leaking) may lead to disciplinary action, including potential immediate termination without warning._

---

**What is the Handbook for?**

The QDF Handbook is a first-hand resource for all QDF operatives. It contains QDF’s rules, general guidelines, in-game protocols, and other information essential to know during service.

When in doubt, refer to this Handbook before contacting a member of Pre-Command or above with your inquiry. The Handbook is subject to change without prior notification. Any operative is welcome to submit suggestions if they notice anything that needs to be added or edited.

_**Last Updated: 23rd December 2024.**_

# **Section 1: RULES**

---

## **Rule 1: No leaking.**

**ALL** QDF operations and communications are strictly classified. This includes ANYTHING sent in the QDF Discords, ANYTHING sent in the Security team chat in-game, and ANYTHING said in QDF voice channels. If it has the QDF logo on it or anything to do with QDF, nothing about it should leave official QDF channels. The ONLY EXCEPTION is for memes in #off-duty. Ask Pre-Command or above before posting them elsewhere if they are memes relating to QDF.

---

## **Rule 2: Do not be stupid.**

QDF operations require you to be professional. This does require you to be able to apply basic common sense to any scenario, as the handbook cannot be all-encompassing of every single possible action you can take. For example, if an employee is repeatedly W/S-ing after being killed twice, you obviously do not need to use the entire warning ladder to place them on KOS. It is important to note your actions outside of QDF may also receive moderation, including actions in QSP, QSERF while off-duty, and DMs to other users affiliated with QS groups. If you are unsure whether or not an action you are going to do is stupid, ask first.

---

## **Rule 3: Do not be disrespectful.**

This rule applies to ALL QS RELATED SERVERS/GROUPS. Regardless of rank or achievements in any part of QS, you are to remain respectful to one another. Discourse and discussion are welcome within QDF/QS, but please do not turn it into a shouting match about who is right. We all hold different perspectives regarding different topics, so please try to respect them. Disrespect to anyone in or out of QDF on an extreme level will not be tolerated and may result in a strike or dismissal based on PC's judgment. We're a relatively small niche of QS. Let's all do our best to get along.

---

## **Rule 4: Follow orders.**

All QDF are expected to listen to others (regardless of rank) and consider and heed all reasonable orders. For example, if an FO asks a JOFC if they could come to help them defend the control room, said JOFC should give due diligence to the request.

However, all QDF _must_ obey **all** orders from others in the rank category above them. The rank categories, from lowest to highest, are JFO-SFO (Operatives), SPC-SSPC (Specialists), JOFC-SOFC (Officers), WO-INS (Pre-Command), and CAPT-DOD (Command).

If you believe the order, you have been given violates any QS rules (whether in QDF or QSP) or is otherwise an improper order, **you must still follow the order**. However, _gather evidence_ and submit it to either Pre-Command or Command. You will not be punished for following a bad order.

If two or more operatives of the same rank category give conflicting orders, you are free to follow either.

Additionally, this is _not_ an excuse to mini-mod. Do not deliberately nitpick what others are doing and then boss them around and/or report them to Pre-Command+. Such behavior will reflect negatively upon you.

---

## **Rule 5: No NSFW. **

No NSFW. Period. NSFW includes all forms of pornography and all forms of gore, as well as types of NSFW not listed here. This rule applies to things you send in chat, your username, and your Discord/server profile.

If you think it might be NSFW, DO NOT POST IT. Additionally, if you are unsure if something is considered NSFW, ask Pre-Command+ _prior_ to posting or applying said item.

---

## **Rule 6: Mind your microphone.**

We encourage using voice chat to communicate with other operatives as it is much more efficient than text chat. However, voice chat is not required. When using voice chat, please keep these guidelines in mind:

- If you have excessive background noise (parents, TV, fans, etc.), either use noise suppression, mute your microphone and use text chat, or use Push-to-Talk. Google “push to talk on Discord” if you want to learn how to set it up.

- When someone else is talking and has something important to say, _be quiet and listen_. Respect what other people have to say.

- If any QDF in your VC/server are in active combat, **stop talking about anything other than combat**. Chatter that isn’t related to combat will hurt the team's performance.

---

## **Rule 7: Use full grammar.**

When speaking in the "On Duty" Discord channel category or public chat in-game, you MUST always use full grammar. Google what full grammar is if you do not know how to use it. Full grammar is _not_ enforced when talking in the "QDF Miscellaneous" Discord channel category or in-game team chat.

---

## **Rule 8: Restricted groups.**

Members of the following groups are banned from QDF. If you are in ANY of these groups, ANY of their subsidiaries, or ANY group related to them, leave them immediately. These groups have been named as threats to Quantum Science:

- Adjacent Science

- Quantam Science 

- QSTF

- QSML3 v3

- Seth’s SCPF

- QSFur

- Vectoral Technologies LLC

- Quantum Science (QS) [Vasilkoo]

- North Star Energy

If they are banned from QS overall, they are banned from QDF.

---

## **Rule 9: Use your brain.**

You have one. Use it. Ask yourself: “Am I about to do something stupid? Will what I am about to do break a rule? Is what I am about to do abusive or something I generally shouldn’t do?” If you answer “yes” to any of these, **_DO NOT DO WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO. _** If you are unsure, don’t do it and ask PC+ first.

---

## **Rule 10: Be active.**

Whether or not there is a defined quota, you are always expected to be somewhat active in the group. However, real life comes first, but QDF still expects activity from you since you chose to join. If you will be inactive for a period equal in length to the quota block or longer, submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) in #loa-notices. Please note that if you are on a LOA lasting **over six months**, you will be contacted by PC+.


_If there is a defined quota_, you must meet it. If you fail to meet it multiple times, you may be struck, suspended, or removed from QDF.

_If there is no defined quota_, please log patrols and chat in the Discord server so PC and Command know you aren’t inactive.

---

## **Rule 11: Raider team restrictions.**

Do not join the Raider team when QDF is drastically outnumbered or is hosting an ongoing special event.

- “Drastically outnumbered” is defined as there being more than 2 Raiders per 1 QDF. For example, if there are 8 Raiders and 4 QDF, you cannot join the Raider team.

“Ongoing special events” include QDF facility tours and any other special event that PC+ may host. They do not include normal events like meltdown evacuations.

You are generally discouraged from joining the Raider team when QDF is struggling. However, the above criteria are _hard limits_ that must be followed.

You are _exempt_ from this rule if:

- You are joining the raider team to participate in a Kleiner Oil Group squadron rally or whole-group raid _that you agreed to participate in prior. _

- You are going to participate in an unplanned KOG flash raid/rally of some sort - however, if you are already on the security team when the event is announced, you may _not_ swap from the security team to the raider team.

---

## **Rule 12: Do not bend the rules.**

We know that some of you like to be clever and exploit loopholes or ambiguities in the rules to get away with anything. This will not be tolerated. Anyone who tries to manipulate the rules will be punished swiftly and harshly. **Do not test us.** This is your warning.

---

## **Rule 13: Control your emotions.**

As a QDF operative, you **will** have to deal with unfair fights. You will be outnumbered, outgunned, and outspoken most of the time. We understand this can be frustrating, but please remember that this is a ROBLOX group at the end of the day. Repeated outbursts of anger are not tolerated and will be dealt with accordingly. This is not to say you are not allowed to be upset, but please consider the operatives working with you and voice yourself in a semi-calm manner. Regarding if raiders/employees are breaking a rules:

-**Report them**. This is the point of QAC. Do not make it your sole mission to harass them or complain about it constantly in VC. Report it and move on.

-Remember: Raiders are able to **buy their weapons**. While this may be frustrating, there is nothing to be done regarding their arsenal from our side. Always remember that it is okay to take a loss; we are usually at a disadvantage.

---

## **Rule 14: No usage of Substances/Alcohol on Duty or within the QDF Discord server.**

QDF is meant to be a welcoming and inclusive environment; as such, you should not be under the influence of alcohol or other illicit substances whilst interacting with the community in QDF. Discussion of these substances is also highly discouraged. If you cannot ensure that you will remain away from QDF whilst under the influence, don't hesitate to get in touch with a member of P.C.+ to be temporarily timed out. If you fail to do so and are found causing issues within QDF, you will be temporarily removed and subsequently given a demerit or strike, depending on the severity.

---

## **Rule 15: The handbook is not the bible.**

Just because it isn't listed here, doesn't mean you can do it. If you are unsure of an action, ASK PC FIRST.  You are expected to apply basic reasoning skills equivalent to a 5th grader, if you are unable to do so, you shouldn't be here. 

---


# **Section 2: GUIDELINES**

---


## **2.1 In-Game Communications**

These guidelines govern communication in Roblox, specifically on QSERF. In general, when communicating, abide by all QDF and QS rules, especially QDF Rule 2. As stated in Rule 1, anything sent in the in-game team chat may not be shown to anyone outside of QDF without approval from Command.


### **_2.1.1 When On Duty_**

- Speak primarily in team chat. This can be done by using `/t<SPACE> `where `<SPACE>` represents you pressing the spacebar. See the “When can I speak in public chat?” heading below for when you can use public chat.

- You must use full grammar when using public chat. You do not have to use full grammar when using team chat.

- _Please ensure that you are sending messages where you intend to send them_. If you intend to speak in team chat, ensure you are speaking in team chat.


#### _2.1.1.1 Spatial Voice_

Spatial Voice is prohibited while on duty for everyone ranked below Pre-Command for a few reasons:

- Spatial Voice has no “team chat” - everyone nearby can hear what you are saying.

- Spatial Voice does not work across the game, hindering communication.

- Many players (QDF and employees alike) do not use/have access to Spatial Voice. Therefore, if you use it, not everyone may be able to hear you.

- We have Discord voice channels for a reason.

If someone speaks to you using Spatial Voice, respond to them in text chat. If you are harassed to “mic up,” treat it like any other instance of harassment.

Pre-Command and above are permitted to use Spatial Voice with due diligence but are strongly discouraged from using it for the above reasons.


### **_2.1.2 When Off Duty_**

Grammar and team chat restrictions do not apply when you are not on the team and not on duty. However, please abide by QDF and QS rules. See Rule 2. Don’t act like an idiot when you are off duty, regardless of whether you are talking in QDF.


### **_2.1.3 When can I speak in public chat?_**

QDF Operatives should use public chat only when necessary. Such situations include and are limited to:

- Issuing warnings to employees. See [Section 3.2] on warnings for more info.

- Answering legitimate questions from employees. A "legitimate question" usually pertains to the game (how something works, what to do during a situation, etc.) and will not result in much further conversation. You can make a Q&A thread if you have a question about if something qualifies. Answering questions is not mandatory. When answering a question, try to have only one nearby person respond. Some examples (non-exhaustive) are:

`  `- "What was the server vote?"

`  `- "How do I do <x> in the game?"

`  `- A CBD is in effect, and employees are wondering what to do

`  `- "How do I join QDF/be an Employee/etc.?" (Note - "community server" will usually not get censored, unlike "Discord")

- Conducting a facility tour. See [Section 3.3] on facility tours for more info.

- Announcing events like Code Black occurring or Tartarus sealing. See the QSERF manual, Section 3.1, for more info.

**Specialists and above** have fewer restrictions for speaking. Namely, they may start and engage in conversations if the following criteria are met:

- Full grammar and professionalism are maintained.

- The conversation’s topic is not outlandish, disrespectful, or something that would break the rules in QDF or QS.

- Raiders are not spoken to unless they are off-team. _However_, if they change teams for the express purpose of talking to you, do not talk with them.

- QDF-related communications remain in team chat.


## **2.2 Discord Communications**

These guidelines govern communication in the QDF Discord. In general, when communicating, abide by all QDF and QS rules, especially QDF Rule 2. All these guidelines also apply to the text channels built into voice channels. As stated in Rule 1, nothing from ANY channel in the Discord may be shown to people who are not QDF without Command approval.


### **_2.2.1 When On Duty_**

- Join one of the On Duty voice channels. If there are other QDF in your server, join the channel that they are in. This lets everyone easily see who is in-game. See Rule 6 for more guidelines.

- You may speak in the #on-duty text chat and make posts in the Q&A forum to ask questions, ask for help, or generally talk with others on duty. Full grammar must be used here.

`    `- _Full grammar should be maintained within the entire On Duty channel category._

- If someone is trying to give useful info to others on duty or give relevant orders, _be quiet and listen. _

`    `- _As stated in Rule 6: “If any QDF in your VC/server are in active combat, _ **_stop talking about anything other than combat_**_. Chatter unrelated to combat will hurt the team's performance.” _

- JOFC+ may sometimes enable the Discord feature _ ** priority speaker ** _ to take control. When this occurs, please be mindful, shut up, listen to them, and follow the instructions provided promptly.

### **_2.2.2 When Off Duty_**

Full grammar does not need to be used in the Off Duty category. The voice channels are also free to use. Feel free to talk about topics other than patrolling, post memes, and generally have fun; however, all QS and QDF rules still apply. If you break any of these rules, you will be punished accordingly.

Don’t act like an idiot when you're off duty, both within and outside of QDF. You are still perceived as a QDF operative, and your actions will shape how people perceive the group.


### **_2.2.3 Special Roles_**

QDF has some unique roles that are assigned to specific members. Any member may ping these roles if they follow the guidelines below:

- **@Rapid Response Team**: This role is self-assigned to anyone who wishes to respond to spontaneous backup calls. If you ever require immediate assistance in game, ping the Rapid Response Team role. This role will be occasionally purged to reduce inactive members.

<!---->

- **@Critical Bug:** This role is assigned to QSERF developers. It is helpful if you discover a game-breaking bug in the main game. Please only issue one ping per bug - multiple people should not ping for the same bug.

-**@Squadron Member** This role is assigned to members in **Squadrons**. If the following conditions are met, it may be pinged for backup unless Squadron Leadership or PC+ states otherwise. Abuse of pinging the role may result in a strike and the removal of pinging permission.

The conditions for said ping are as follows:

Unless an exception is made by a Squadron Officer or above, only QDF Specialist and above may ping the Squadrons role.

`     `- At least one @Rapid Response Team ping must have been made.

`     `- There must be a QDF:Raider ratio of 1:2 with at least 3 active QDF and 8 active Raiders.

`     `- Raider numbers must have been stable for ~5 minutes.

`     `- Any and all conditions may be overwritten with the approval of Squadron Leadership.

-**@Group Patrols** This role is for those who would like to participate in a patrol that JOFC+ often hosts. They can sometimes consist of a raider-less patrol, which depends on PC+ approval. Below are additional guidelines for those who aren’t JOFC+  but would like to ping the role for the patrol. 

`     `- May be pinged once an hour unless overridden for an event or JOFC+

`     `- May be used in on-duty and/or game nights

`     `- You must paste your profile link similar to RRT

`     `- Anyone *with* the group patrol’s role may use this ping.

` `This isn't RRT 2.0; only use this ping in servers with little to no combat.


## **2.3 Strikes**

We have a very strict strike system in QDF, as we want our members to be competent. Strikes are given at the discretion of Pre-Command and Command. A <a name="_hlk180160332"></a>_non-comprehensive list of reasons why someone may be striked is:

- Repeated failure to follow instructions.

- Repeated failure to meet the activity quota by a large margin.

- Generally breaking any QS or QDF rules/guidelines.

- Ordering others to break QS or QDF rules/guidelines.

Everyone who is ranked _Junior Field Operative and above_ is subject to this strike system:

1. **First strike:** No consequence.

2. **Second strike**Demotion by one rank.*

3. **Third strike:** Removal. *

_Punishments may vary_ depending on the severity of the offense.
_If you have more than three strikes by the time this is written you are grandfathered in.

_* = If you can be demoted that far. For example, a Junior Field Operative would be immediately removed from the group if they reached strike #3._


### **_2.3.1 Getting Strikes Removed_**

There are two methods for getting strikes removed.

1. **Contesting a strike:** Operatives may contest any strikes that they feel are unfair. Strikes older than two (2) weeks _may_ _not_ be contested. There is no limit to how many strikes one may contest. Evidence/explanation of unfairness is necessary. If the strike is deemed unfair, it will be removed from _all_ records.

2. **Reviewing a strike:** Operatives may request that a strike be reviewed after six (6) months have passed since it was issued. *Only one (1) strike may be appealed every two (2) weeks if they are older than six (6) months.* Operatives may only request a review if they believe their behavior has improved. Evidence is helpful, but operatives will not be penalized for not having any. If the review is accepted, the strike will no longer be held against you, though it will still be recorded for archival purposes.


## **2.4 KOS Guidelines and Raiders**

### **_2.4.1 KOS Guidelines_**

“KOS” means “kill on sight.” This means that if you see someone who is on KOS, then you kill them. Command maintains a list of people who are on KOS in the #kos-list channel in the Infoboard category. This list may be updated anytime (usually with a ping). Some KOS orders may be temporary, while others may be permanent.

**Only Command can issue KOS orders.** Anyone other than Command who issues KOS orders breaks rules 2, 3, and 4. Use the #kos-request channel in the On Duty category to request someone to be on KOS.

**The only KOS that you may enact on your own is an “Event KOS.”** An Event KOS is a temporary KOS order that lasts until the current event (i.e. meltdown or maintenance mode) finishes. Employees may be placed under an Event KOS for a few reasons:

- Continually doing prohibited actions that go against the server vote (i.e. repeatedly turning the relief valves when the vote was meltdown).

- Continually annoying/harassing QDF, even after following the proper warning chain (see [Section 3.2]). 

If you place someone on Event KOS within a minute or two of the current event ending, _the KOS may be extended until the end of the next event._

If you place someone under Event KOS, inform them of what is happening and why as best you can.


### **_2.4.2 Raiders_**

Raiders are KOS. **Always.** They will whine and complain, but you will kill them anyway. You will kill them no matter what they are doing and regardless of if they are armed. If you see a Raider, do not hesitate to kill them. _They signed away their right to live when they bought the gamepass and joined the team._

However, you may _not_ engage with Raiders in the following areas:

- The area outside of their spawn near the Foxtrot vent annex.

- The maintenance hallways outside of the vents _unless they are spawn camping you._

Please also refrain from camping in Sublevel 3 for extended periods of time. You may engage Raiders in SL3 if you see them passing through, but try to avoid camping.


#### _2.4.2.1 Special Notes About Raider Combat_

Certain features in QSERF become available if a certain amount of QDF are on duty in a server. Raiders can override blast doors and the Tartarus lockdown if there are five (5) or more QDF on duty, and the warhead data heist is available if six (6) or more QDF are on duty. For these features that require a certain number of QDF to be present, this point must be made incredibly clear:

**Do not leave the server to prevent events from triggering or to prevent Raiders from doing certain things only to rejoin after they can’t occur.**

This is a petty and cowardly tactic. It also frustrates many Raiders, who spent a hefty amount of Robux on their game pass (es). If you call for backup, be prepared for an influx of Raiders and be ready to fight. We are more coordinated than the Raiders and can gather backup faster than them. Use these to your advantage.

Also, sometimes you need to accept a loss. **_Losing is okay. Do not be a sore loser._**


## **2.5 Activity Logs and Quotas**

Activity logs demonstrate your activity in QSERF. Your activity is an essential metric that PC and Command use to determine how committed you are to the group. Of course, it is not the only thing that we measure.


### **_2.5.1 Current Quota_**

The current quota is: **over two (2) weeks, patrol at least twice and for at least 70 minutes _total_**.

- **Example that meets the quota:** “Over two weeks, I do one patrol that is 30 minutes long, and then another patrol that is 40 minutes long.”

If you fail to meet the quota, you will be given an activity strike. Two (2) activity strikes are equivalent to one (1) regular strike.

When logging activity, _all members_ (OIT+) must patrol for at least **30 minutes**. No member may patrol for longer than **nine (9) hours** without taking a break of **at least one (1) hour**. In addition, the maximum amount of minutes you are allowed to patrol in one month is 6,000 minutes, equivalent to 100 hours. If you exceed this amount, you will be put on suspension immediately. 

If you will be absent for at least **two (2) weeks** (the length of a quota block), please submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) notice in the #loa-notices channel.

You will be given an activity strike if you fail to meet the quota. Two (2) activity strikes are equivalent to one (1) regular strike.


**NOTE:** If you are in Squadrons, you do _not_ have to fulfill the QDF quota. Your specific activity requirements are dictated by your specific squadron.

###  **_2.5.2 Leaving process**

As with everything, your time here in QDF will eventually end. There are only two ways this can happen: you leave yourself, which will be explained in the process below, or you are removed. In the latter case, PC+ will deal with the processing steps to remove you from the group.

If you choose to leave on your own, these are the steps to leave: 

- Step 1: Notify a member of PC+ and confirm they have understood, so that they may give you time to say goodbye.

- Step 2 (optional): Create a goodbye message and send it to off-duty.

- Step 3: Leave the QDF group.

- Step 4: Leave QDF Discord.


Let it be known that if you choose to leave and attend a tryout within a couple of months, you will not be let back in until a later date.

### **_2.5.3 Logging Activity_**

#### _2.5.3.1 Operatives in Training (OITs)_

- Your quota is to log **at least six (6) patrols**. Of these patrols, **at least five (5)** of the logs must be accepted by a PC+ member.

- Please fill out the “Manual/OIT Activity Log” format in the #formats channel when logging your activity.

- Send your activity logs in the #oit-activity-logs channel.

- The ending times of your logs must be separated by **at least 24 hours**. For example, if your current patrol ends at 3:00 PM, you cannot end and log another patrol until at least 3:00 PM on the next day.

- Most of this information is referenced in the #training-phase channel.


#### _2.5.3.2 Other non-PC members_

Manual logging is disallowed unless the bot (QDF Helper) is broken or down. If the bot is having issues, please contact Director Aerasto or Commander Sealyy23 and ask for permission to log manually. If none of the above are available, contact another member in PC+.

Activity logging with the bot is relatively simple. To log a patrol, first ensure that you are verified with the bot (`/operatives verify`). Then, follow these steps:

1. Run `/patrols start` in #activity-logs when you want to begin your patrol (usually once you get in game and switch onto the Security team).

2. Patrol like normal. You can swap servers as many times as you wish. Before you finish your patrol, be sure to take a screenshot of your entire Roblox client showing you on the Security team.

3. When you finish patrolling (when you are done playing QSERF or done playing on the Security team), run `/patrols end` in #activity-logs, using the screenshot you took in step #2.

4. If the bot says your log is over, you are done!

If you cannot stay for at least 30 minutes, use the `/patrols cancel` command with the log ID you were given when you started the log.

# **Section 3: OPERATIONS**

---


## **3.1 QSERF Manual**

This section of the Handbook covers most things that you’ll need to know while patrolling in-game.

The Handbook is the official resource, but another useful resource that you may reference is [Yordanian's Compendium](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17nhST1uQlD3rPVJuYUjPolcFj6PEHMbCXmdFb2SqXmw/edit#heading=h.8nla4xarxp03). It goes in depth on some information that the Handbook does not. If there is a conflict between the Compendium and the Handbook, the Handbook is correct.


### **_3.1.1 Scenarios_**

#### _3.1.1.1 Normal Operations (NO)_

NO is the scenario you’ll be in most of the time. During NO, you only need to be concerned with normal duties, such as patrolling the facility, killing Raiders when you see them, conducting server votes (and tours occasionally), and so on. Key areas include the DMR Control Room (DMR CR) and chamber, Pump Station Alpha, and the Warhead Control Room (WCR).

If there are no Raiders online or QDF outnumbers Raiders by at least 2:1, you may also be more proactive in helping employees manage the DMR. How the DMR is managed depends on the server vote (see [Section 3.1.4](#314-server-votes) for more details). For example, if the vote is “preserve,” you may help employees fulfill power orders. You may speak to do so (see Sections [2.1.2](#212-when-off-duty) and [2.1.3](#213-when-can-i-speak-in-public-chat)). This is not required, and you _should not_ punish employees for going against what you say _unless they are going against the vote_. This does not include power orders during a preserve vote - you are not required to enforce those.


#### _3.1.1.2 Protocol Saletum (PSL)_

Protocol Saletum is more commonly known as “the warhead.” It is probably the second most common scenario you’ll be in.

Once you hear any warhead announcement, you should immediately drop whatever you are doing and respond. Your objective is to either disarm the warhead using the red “Cancel” button in the WCR or otherwise prevent the warhead from detonating. While the warhead is active, you are permitted to kill anyone who is not an Administrator in Sublevel-4 and _only_ in Sublevel-4. If the warhead is inactive, you must follow the proper warning protocol in Section 3.2.

This is a general overview of the warhead priming/detonation sequence:

1. _Raiders begin priming the warhead._ This is when the first announcement plays.

2. _Raiders are locked out for 40 seconds._ This is the only time you can use the red “Cancel” button in the WCR.

3. _Raiders must search for detonation keys._ Their locations will be revealed to you and Raiders. You should either guard these keys or guard the WCR.

4. _The raiders confirm detonation._ In order to finish confirming detonation, Raiders must press the detonation button after turning the keys and then use their keycard one last time. If the Raiders are about to finish confirming detonation, switch your focus to securing and defending Tartarus. You may try to “engage cancel” or let the warhead time out right before detonation, but that does not happen often. Act like a CBD (Code Black Directive, see sections below) was just activated. Begin following COD (Code Omni Directive) protocol sometime before the 60-second detonation announcement.

During each phase, if the warhead sits idle for too long, it will automatically cancel. This is a valuable tool since the red “Cancel” button is only available for about 40 seconds in the beginning of the sequence.


#### _3.1.1.3 Code Red Directive (CRD)_

A CRD is announced in the first phase of DMR meltdown. The warhead will be disabled, so you do not need to worry about it. At this point, two options lie ahead of you, depending on the server vote:

1. _The server voted for a DMR shutdown._ If this is your situation, focus on shutting down the DMR. To shut down, the DMR must be below 3000K, none of the power lasers can be broken, and the EFSS tanks must be filled to at least 80%. You may help direct the employees on how to shut the DMR down, but do not abuse them or be overly bossy. If you need to, follow the warning protocol in Section 3.2.

`   `If a shutdown ever becomes impossible (i.e., a power laser breaks), initiate a Pre-emptive Code Black Directive (PCBD, see below).

2. _The server voted for a DMR meltdown._ If this is your situation, initiate a PCBD.


#### _3.1.1.4 Pre-emptive Code Black Directive (PCBD)_

A PCBD is the same thing as a Code Black Directive (CBD), **except** that you _may not_ lock Tartarus down (_tip: if you keep one Tartarus fan on and one-off, you can soft-lock Tartarus. Keep at least one fan off so you can turn it on when someone else turns the other fan off_). Otherwise, begin heading to Tartarus and encourage others to start evacuating. A PCBD may only occur if:

- The server voted for a meltdown.

- The server voted for a Phase 1 shutdown, but a Phase 1 shutdown is impossible (temperature too high, power laser broken, etc.).

- PC+ authorizes it.

If the server voted for a meltdown (and only a meltdown), you may initiate the Radiation Seal from the DMR CR. The Radiation Seal prevents anyone from entering the DMR chamber or performing a Phase 2 shutdown.

#### _3.1.1.5 Code Black Directive (CBD)_

A CBD happens at the beginning of the second meltdown phase whenever the Phase 1 shutdown fails, or the Phase 1 shutdown timer expires. At this point, you **may** engage the Tartarus security lockdown. Again, you have two paths ahead of you, depending on the server vote:

1. _The server voted for a DMR shutdown._ If this is your situation and a Phase 2 shutdown looks possible, gather enough people on the DMR superstructure to perform the shutdown. A Phase 2 shutdown requires at least three people to eject all fuel cells within 1-3 seconds of the others. Do not spam the fuel cell levers when ejecting. If a Phase 2 shutdown does not become available (the announcement about blast shelters will play) or fails, abandon the shutdown and follow item #2 on this list. 

`    `1. Note: Some QDF may still want to go to Tartarus and follow the steps in item #2 below.

2. _The server voted for a DMR meltdown_. If this is your situation, evacuating and securing Tartarus are your priorities. QDF should split between the topside and bottom-side Tartarus to control it. If a Phase 2 shutdown was not voted for/is not possible, you may also engage the Radiation Seal if you have not already done so. Keep evacuating employees via the lift until a Code Omni Directive (COD) is announced.

`    `1. Note: The security lockdown will prevent employees from using the Tartarus controls, so only terminate them if they are being _extreme_ nuisances.

Requirements for _automatic early sealing of Tartarus_ are a maximum of 4 QDF, with a minimum 1:2 QDF:Raider ratio, where QDF are unable to gain any control room for an extended period of time. 

For an automatic early seal, QDF are authorized to lock down Tartarus during any point during meltdown and to seal Tartarus after the Code Black announcement.


#### _3.1.1.6 Code Omni Directive (COD)_

A COD happens approximately two (2) minutes before the DMR explodes. You may still have people evacuating, but you should begin preparing to seal Tartarus. Be sure to clear out any Raiders or have people designated to fight them so you may continue unimpeded.

Commonly, the last lift is announced before the 30-second warning and sent up shortly after. Announcements that can be used can be found at the top of Section 3.1. Be sure to guard both the topside and bottom side from Raiders, even after the door seals, especially if there are 5 or more QDF on. If Tartarus seals before/as the DMR is detonating and Raiders don’t override it, then congratulations!


### **_3.1.2 Power System_**

QDF Operatives have access to adjust the power system/the grid. Since the grid is connected to many things in QSERF, _do not abuse this privilege_. Additionally, **_you do not gain the right to be Corporate because you are QDF. Anyone using QDF as the primary/major reason they should be Corporate will be punished._** Mentioning QDF in passing (maybe, such as how it helped you learn about QSERF and/or get involved with the community) is fine. Just **do** **not** use being QDF as the primary/a major reason for why you should be Corporate.


#### _3.1.2.1 How Does the Grid Work?_

The power grid controls are in the same area as the turbine hall and generators. To get there, take the Primary Sublevel Utility Elevator (the yellow elevator inside the maintenance tunnels) down to Sublevel 2. You can also get there from the elevators near the bottom side of Tartarus. The levers on the grid controls determine which grid the facility draws power from (primary or auxiliary). Switching grids is as easy as pulling the corresponding lever. _However, be careful_. If you switch to a grid that does not have enough power for the facility, a blackout will occur. Additionally, things connected to one grid will not provide power if you are using the other grid. For example, the turbines will not provide power to the facility if you are using the auxiliary grid.


#### _3.1.2.2 The Primary Grid_

The turbines are connected to the _primary_ grid and generate power using the DMR. They generate a reasonably large amount of power, so you shouldn’t have to worry about the grid as long as the DMR is warm enough. The turbines are also simple to control since all you must do is turn them on or off.


#### _3.1.2.3 The Auxiliary Grid_

The generators and the Foxtrot-9 reactor are connected to the _auxiliary_ grid. All three generators are necessary to keep the facility powered. The generators must be turned on (the green button on each generator) and fueled to work. There is a shelf for generator fuel in the room where the generators are, and you can get more fuel by ordering it on a shipment truck (the shipment area is outside of bottomside Tartarus). Generators can only be refueled if they are offline and below ~40% fuel.

Alternatively, Foxtrot-9 can power the facility, but Foxtrot-9 must be synced with the grid, which is not a trivial task. Having a generator or two online is also recommended just in case Foxtrot-9 stops making power.


### **_3.1.3 Door Controls_**

QDF can control all the hydraulic blast doors and automatic sliding doors in QSERF (not push-bar doors). This allows for greater control over the flow of friendly and hostile units within the facility. However, it also impedes gameplay for regular players, so use these controls sparingly.


#### _3.1.3.1 Methods of Door Control_

Doors can be controlled in three ways:

1. Each hydraulic blast door has a keycard reader next to it that can manually override the door’s current state. The override lasts for ~160 seconds.

2. There is a panel of switches in the upper level of QDF spawn that has a switch for each controllable door in QSERF. It also has a switch to force all sliding doors open. The “open” and “closed” states force the door in question to be either open or closed, and the “automatic” state enables the cooldown for hydraulic blast doors mentioned in item 1.

3. There is a “CR lockdown” button in the security room inside the DMR CR. This button sounds an alarm, seals all entrances to the DMR CR for ~90 seconds, disables the blast door keycard readers, and has a cooldown of ~40 seconds after the lockdown finishes.


#### _3.1.3.2 Permissions_

**SFO+** are permitted to individually override hydraulic blast doors if there are 4+ Raiders online or if Pre-Command+ authorizes it. They are also permitted to use the switch in the spawn door control room that forces the sliding doors open, but only when a meltdown starts or the warhead's key phase begins. Closing blast doors significantly impedes gameplay for non-combatants, so **only close them when absolutely necessary** and **re-open them as soon as possible**.

**SPC+** are permitted to use the “CR lockdown” button if 3+ Raiders are conducting an extended attack on the DMR CR (extended meaning attacking DMR CR for 5+ minutes) or to trap Raiders inside after QDF have entered to clear them out. They may also use this button if PC+ authorizes it.

**JOFC+** may use all the switches in the spawn door control room, as long as there are at least 5+ QDF online (to allow Raiders to override for balancing).

Note: If there are 5+ QDF online, Raiders _are able to override hydraulic doors_ as well as Tartarus. Don’t bet on the hydraulic doors staying open or closed.


### **_3.1.4 Server Votes_**

Server votes are relatively easy to conduct. The command “`!QDFvote`” sends a prompt to all players asking for their vote. It will tally the results and report back to you.

There are three options for the vote:

- Meltdown. If this wins, attempt to melt the DMR down completely. Do not attempt any shutdowns.

- Shutdown. If this wins, attempt both a Phase 1 shutdown (using the shutdown code) and a Phase 2 shutdown (â…“ chance to be able to eject all the DMR fuel cells).

- Preserve. If this wins, do not let the DMR meltdown. You may ensure this in any way you see fit aside from abusing employees. Abusing employees is not tolerated. You may only harm employees if they are going against the vote and after you follow the proper warning ladder (see [Section 3.2](#32-warnings)).


## **3.2 Warnings**

This section refers to giving warnings in QSERF. For strikes (punishments for Operatives), see [Section 2.3](#23-strikes).

Warnings are what you issue to people when they are severely misbehaving in QSERF. There is a clear process for giving warnings so that they are only given to those who need them.


### **_3.2.1 When Can I Give Warnings?_**

You may only give warnings under these circumstances:

- Someone is in your face, on your head, pushing you around, or deliberately trying to annoy you. Someone is too close if the barrel of your gun touches them while you are standing still.

- Someone is tampering with the controls, usually to resist the server vote.

- Someone is deliberately being a nuisance to others in-game.

You should NOT give warnings in the following circumstances:

- Someone is hacking/exploiting, spamming, has an appropriate username, is being extremely toxic, or is otherwise doing something that needs a moderator. **Call someone from QAC to the server by opening a QCOD ticket.**

- Someone is using controls in a manner that requires said controls to be spammed.

Please note that these lists of conditions are not comprehensive. If you have questions, ask QDF Pre-Command or Command.


### **_3.2.2 How do I Give Warnings?_**

Warnings are issued in QSERF public chat. As such, grammar rules must be followed. Some example warnings are provided below. A âœ… marks a proper warning and a âŒ marks an improper warning.

- âœ… â€œPlease stop spamming the controls.â€

- âœ… â€œPlease get off of my head.â€

- âœ… â€œBack away.â€

- âŒ â€œget offâ€ (does not have full grammar)

- âŒ â€œWarning 1, donâ€™t mess with the controls.â€ (We never say â€œWarning 1,â€ â€œWarning 2,â€ â€œFinal warning,â€ etc.)

If violence is necessary, progress along the following ladder:

1. Two or three verbal warnings

2. Two or three singular hits with the baton (do not chase people if you cannot hit them, proceed along the ladder)

3. Two or three warning shots

4. Termination (kill them)

You may only skip steps in this ladder if someone is on KOS (either global KOS or event KOS) or if someone is actively prohibiting you from performing your duties. Otherwise, do not skip steps.


## **3.3 Facility Tours**

Facility tours are events in which QDF Operatives conduct a group of players through the facility so that they learn more about it.


### **_3.3.1 Conditions for Tours_**

Tours may only happen if the following conditions are met:

- At least one (1) Specialist+ is online to host, and at least two (2) other Junior Field Operative+ are online.

- No more than two (2) active Raiders are present.

- A tour has not been conducted on that server within the last hour.

There is no limit to how many people may be on a tour.

If more than two (2) active Raiders appear or if a facility event occurs (meltdown, warhead, etc.), or if the QDF _not_ on the tour are struggling to deal with Raiders, cease the tour and tend to the situation.


### **_3.3.2 Guidelines for Conducting Tours_**

Tours begin in the tour group waiting room at Topside Tartarus. Be sure to allow people some time to gather before beginning.

You are suggested to limit questions to two (2) per area _at most_ so you can finish the tour quickly, but you may allow extra if time permits. You are not required to answer trollish questions.

If people give you problems during a tour, you may follow the warning protocol in Section 3.2..

Below is a list of areas you should visit and a brief description of what you should cover.

- Tartarus. Explain the controls and explain that this is where you can go to survive a meltdown and a warhead. Make a note of the delivery area as well.

- Blast shelters. Address these when you get near one, making a note of how you can survive a DMR meltdown in them.

- Hadron Collider. Explain how to make DMR fuel cells here. You may also make note of the employee-only route here and how people in the group can use it to traverse the facility faster.

Foxtrot-9. This isn’t mandatory, but you can show them the reactor and explain that it’s a more realistic simulation for them to use.

- Pump Station Alpha. Please explain what the pumps are and how to use them.

- The DMR Control Room. Briefly explain what the CR is and what the controls are.

- The changing room and DMR chamber. Do not use the employee-only route to get here. Have everyone put on a hazmat suit and venture into the chamber. Explain where the fuel cells, internal coolant pumps, and EFSS are.

- Maintenance tunnels. Note the paths to the Hadron Collider and Pump Station Alpha.

- Generators and turbines. Explain how the grid works, noting the difference between the primary and auxiliary grids and the potential for blackouts. Also, it explains that Corporate+ can control the grid more than regular employees can.

# **Section 4: DRESS CODE AND LOADOUTS**

---


## **4.1 Dress Code and Proper Attire**

Many groups similar to QDF maintain strict dress codes, and QDF is no different. The dress code is designed to keep our appearance consistent with our values and to distinguish us from other players while in-game. All ranks must follow the dress code.

Each rank has specific uniforms and accessories that they may wear, outlined below. The general dress code that applies to all members regardless of rank is as follows:

- Skin color must be reasonably realistic (a natural color you could expect someone to have in real life).

- Accessories and hairstyles are only permitted if they:

- Are simple and conservative (meaning “not outlandish, not extremely large, not overly flamboyant, and not extremely distracting”),

-They are relatively realistic and do not cover large parts of the uniform.

- Face Style: Only classic Roblox faces are permitted during patrols on duty.

- Any non-classic faces require explicit permission from PC+ (Pre-Command or higher) before use.

- Approved non-classic faces should be minimalistic, avoiding exaggerated or disproportionate features such as large eyes.

- For questions or to request approval, members should inquire in the designated “*General Avatar/UGC Item Questions*” channel, where PC accepts or denies requests.

-Display names must be professional and appropriate (nothing that would break QDF or QS rules).

- **NOTE**: Do not “clone” display names by setting yours to the same as others. This is unprofessional, and those found doing this will be suspended until their display names are changed.

While members have some freedom to express themselves, they should also consider the appearance of a professional security guard. Find a balance between personal expression and professionalism.

## **4.2 Rank-Specific Dress Codes and Arsenals**

Each rank is permitted to wear and carry what the ranks below it may wear and carry.

- **NOTE**: Baton is to be used when giving out warnings to employees as part of the warning guidelines; however, it is the **LAST** resort when confronting raiders, and you should always use your secondary. Primary -> Secondary -> Baton.

# **Section 5: QDF Squadrons**

---

The elite sub-groups of QDF are called the Squadrons. These units are specialized groups with experienced and skilled QDF operatives who train in specific combat techniques to win any engagement, regardless of the odds.

## **5.1 Admittance**

Admittance into a Squadron is by tryout only. QDF members ranked SFO and, above all have access to the QDF squadron's server to see all guidelines and have the chance to attend a tryout.

Do not request an invitation to a squadron or a tryout to be hosted. Asking will only lower your odds.

### _5.1.1 Transparency Notice_

Naturally, as a subgroup of security, all squadrons are still part of QDF. Transparency between everyone is made to prevent toxicity and drama and ensure operatives know if a Squadron operative is going against the squadron's terms. If you see a Squadron member disobeying base QDF or Squadron guidelines, we urge you to contact any member of Squadron leadership. Furthermore, if you believe there is an issue with Squadron leadership, please contact a member of Unified Squadron Command. Squadron Leadership's and Unified Commands' DMs are always open to answer any further questions you may have.

## **5.2 Unified Squadron Rules**

### 5.2.1: No Elitist Behavior

While Squadron operators may be elite, their attitude toward others is expected to be of elite quality. If they are found to be toxic, condescending, or derogatory towards anyone, they will be removed without warning and face consequences in main QDF.

### 5.2.2: Professional conduct consistently upheld

Whether on or off duty, you are expected to uphold professionalism. The elites of QDF must exemplify such qualities through their behavior towards others. Anyone found to infringe on their squadron's image will be swiftly reprimanded.

### 5.2.3: No Leaking

The operations of any squadron are highly classified. All information you are given access to should be held at that level. For example, Squadron command information should not be released outside of the channel unless authorized.

### 5.2.4: Mutual respect

We are all QDF members and share the goal of defending all Quantum Science property and personnel. We must and are expected to work together as one team to achieve that goal.

### 5.2.5: Follow all QDF guidelines

This should go without saying: Follow all main QDF guidelines. Those found to have broken them will be dealt with accordingly.

## **5.3 Squadron Leadership Ranks**

5.3.1: Squadron ranks do not superseded QDF ranks at __any time__, except these listed below during __Squadron Events__

Squadron leadership is broken down into three tiers.

- __Unified Squadron Command__ oversees and reviews all policies from Squadron Leadership. They also directly moderate any miscommunication or disagreements between the squadrons and serve as a direct link between squadron leadership and QDF pre-command. Superseded in the game by Pre Command+.

- __Squadron Command__ oversee and coordinate all of their *specific* unit’s operations and operators. They have the final say on everything related to their squadron, and their control over unit members is only being superseded by Unified Squadron Command and QDF Junior Instructor+. Superseded in game by Pre Command+.

- __Squadron Officers__ are talented leaders *within* the squadrons who host squadron responses and other squadron events. These members are talented tactical leaders tasked with leading and advising QDF members around them during squadron events. Superseded in game by QDF Officer+ if not an officer.

## **5.4 Squadron Loadouts**

### 5.4.1: All Squadrons have their own unit-specific loadouts.

### 5.4.2:If an item has restrictions listed for a lower rank, you must follow those unless you are at a rank where it is otherwise stated.

### 5.4.3:Resp. use: You may only use the unlocked gear during Squadron events.

### 5.4.4:Free use: You may use the unlocked gear outside Squadron events.

|**Rank**|**SEU**|**CIU**|

|Squadron Captain / Unified Command|Free: All Squadron Arsenals|Free: All Squadron Arsenals|

## **5.5 Squadron Weapon Guidelines**

Squadron operators, being the elite combative of QDF, are expected to be lethal with most weapons that they are given. Therefore, operators are expected to use their weaponry within reason. However, there are some scenarios where you can use your weaponry even during some unfair ratios. During PSL/Meltdown, we encourage you to respond to heavy raider weapons, even if QDF outnumbers raiders, with heavy weapons of your own. But be mindful of your situation. __Only use the minimum force necessary to achieve victory__ in an engagement, and always follow weapon restriction guidelines. This is to keep things fair and balanced and to keep combat interesting for both sides.

In saying that, there are some hard limits of the Juggernaut armor that there are NO EXCEPTIONS to. This can only be circumvented if a Squadron Captain or above gives you their explicit permission.

- 5.5.1: 1 QDF: 1.5 Raiders

- 5.5.2: The juggernaut suit may only be utilized with the following primary weapons: M4, AA-12, M60, Min-134, and RPG-7.

## 5.5.3: Shield Disclaimer

You should not “shield rush” without at least 1 (preferably 2 or more) teammate(s) to accompany you. You can and will get yourself killed. Retreating with the shield in hand is permitted, but do not use it continuously; use it within reason, and don’t be foolish. Your secondary is issued to you for a reason.

## **5.6 Uniform Guidelines**

The Squadrons are given exceptions from the general QDF dress code. These are outlined below.

Extended Dress Code (Unlocked at Senior Operator)

Certain members of QDF Squadrons are permitted to wear helmets, usually unlocked at the rank of JOFC. These helmets are optional; however, if you choose to wear them, the following regulations must be followed:

- It should be made by "Foxtrot Arms" or "JohnDrinkin," though other UGC creators should also be acceptable.

- It has to be a FAST Helmet, but Slipstream, Extrac, Mich, and PASGT-style Helmets are also acceptable.

- It has to be Black, Dark Grey, or Blue, and helmet covers, or snakeskin are fine—though camos are not.

- Helmet Add-Ons such as “FAST Add-on (TA)” and add-ons with police patches are prohibited, though flag patches representing one’s own nationality or LGTBQ+ solidarity are fine.

- NVGs are prohibited, though you can use the NVG Bracket accessory.

If you are unsure about an accessory, ping a member of your Squadron’s leadership to confirm. 

During Squadron responses and events, JOPR+ must wear their Squadron Tactical Uniform unless instructed otherwise by Squadron Command or above. Initiates will continue to wear their respective uniforms as they have yet to be permitted to wear a Squadron Tactical Uniform.

# **Section 7: MISCELLANEOUS**

---

## **7.1: Publicity Branch**

The QDF Publicity Branch is a dedicated team within QDF that creates and manages promotional content, instructional videos, and other media, supporting QDF’s public image and community engagement. Unlike the Quantum Broadcasting Corporation (QBC), which works on a variety of projects not limited to QDF, the Publicity Branch focuses exclusively on QDF-related projects, including promotional videos, training guides, and community outreach content.

### **7.1.1: Eligibility Requirements**

To participate in the Publicity Branch, members must:

- Hold the rank of **SFO (Senior Field Operative) or above**.

- Have a **positive track** record within QDF, demonstrating reliability and adherence to QDF’s standards.

### **7.1.2: Joining the Publicity Branch**

Members interested in joining the Publicity Branch may opt-in by contacting a Pre-Command member, preferably through a ping to an available Pre-Command member.

### **7.1.3: Roles and Responsibilities**

Those granted access to the Publicity Branch will have opportunities to:

- Assist with body and voice acting for QDF media projects.

- Participate in quality testing as needed.

- Direct QDF-related projects with approval, as long as they align with QDF’s objectives and do not duplicate QBC’s non-QDF project scope.

A project submission form will soon be available for members to propose new content ideas.

### **7.1.4 Conduct and Confidentiality**

As members of the Publicity Branch, all participants are expected to uphold QDF’s rules, including maintaining confidentiality. Breaches of trust, such as leaking restricted information, will be treated as severe infractions, resulting in removal from the Publicity Branch and potential further disciplinary action.

## **7.2 VIP Servers**

In VIP servers that are **not** a part of VIP raids or official QS events, normal regulations surrounding patrolling do not apply. You are free to join the security team and have fun, while still keeping a few things in mind:

- While normal patrolling restrictions do not apply, QDF rules do. Don’t be an idiot. Your conduct in QSERF represents QDF, VIP server or not.

- Respect the wishes of the VIP server owner. Don’t abuse your privileges in a manner that upsets the owner of the VIP server. Such conduct is punishable.

- Unless authorized by PC+, you may not log patrols that happen in VIP servers. VIP raids _are_ authorized, though.

In VIP servers that **are** a part of VIP raids or official QS events, **all** Handbook regulations apply unless stated otherwise by QDF Pre-Command+.

## **7.3 Achievements**

Operatives may earn a set of achievements if they make a request with evidence in the `#achievement-requests` channel.

The available achievements, with descriptions and evidence requirements, are as follows:

- **4-hour Patrol**: Patrol for at least 4 hours, showing a log as proof. *Please note that the 8-hour patrol achievement has been retired and is no longer claimable*

- **Marksman**: In at least 3 video clips, kill or deal majority damage and final blow to 3+ raiders before dying in each clip

- **Teammate**: In at least 3 video clips, complete any team-based scenario (retaking an objective, clearing an area, or successfully evacuating) as a team of 2 or more with efficient teamwork/communication for each clip

- **Patroller**: Log at least an hour-long patrol for 4+ days in a row

- **Capturer**: In at least 2 pairs of video clips, retake and secure either the DMR Control Room or the Sublevel-4 Annex and successfully defend against an enemy push afterward in at least 1:1.5 odds, solo or as a team, for each pair of clips. (One clip for securing the area, one clip for defending against a push)

- **Sherriff**: In at least 3 video clips, successfully cancel the warhead before it reaches the key phase solo or as a team for each clip
